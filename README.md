# Expression Tree

It is a practical example of the construction of an expression tree given a language through an automata which validates whether the word (i.e., expression given) is accepted using a lexer scan through a regular expression so that it generates tokens. Being like that it could be easily used as a tiny library of an automaton just removing some classes we are not interested on.
